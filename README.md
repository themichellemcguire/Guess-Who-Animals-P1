### Intended Audience is for ages 3 and up

*Object of the Game*
<p class="object">The object of the game is to "ask" the computer yes or no questions to figure out the secret animal using the process of elimination.
</p>
*Setup*
<p>The screen will show all 12 animal images in a grid on the main screen. The animal attributes to choose from will display on the right in a sidebar. As the screen loads, audio will say, "Can you guess my animal?"
</p>
*Play*
<p>The way to play the game is by selecting an attribute from the options given on the right. The player will click an attribute and the computer will answer either, "Yes, I have ()!" or "No, I don't have ()!"
</p>
<p>Once the computer has answered, the player will select animal images that they don't want to keep in order to narrow down their selections as to the secret animal. Those selections will be "turned over" after the player clicks on them. At this point, the player will select an additional attribute, until they are left with only one image. If that image is the same as the computer's secret image, the player wins and they'll hear, "Hooray! You won!" If the player is incorrect, the player will hear, "Sorry, you didn't guess my secret animal." The secret image will then appear on the screen.
